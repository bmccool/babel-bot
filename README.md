### What is this repository for? ###

This repository is for the BeaglePlayer project.  This is a spin off of the BeagleVision project that aims to record user input files for NES games and play them back, as well as playing of common TAS files for the NES.For more info, see the [notebook](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=39227574E31A4574!675&authkey=!AOqkbbqrZhCvqdE&ithint=onenote%2c).


### How do I get set up? ###

The target is a BeagleBoneBlack Rev C. Other needed materials are currently in flux, but check the [Notebook](https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=39227574E31A4574!675&authkey=!AOqkbbqrZhCvqdE&ithint=onenote%2c) for more info.  To get started, simple clone the project to the BeagleBone, run make, and run the executable BeaglePlayer.  The BeagleBone is currently using the pre-installed Debian OS.

Edit: To facilitate debugging and faster development, the project is currently being used on an Ubuntu Desktop installation.  This is done so that we have more robust display capabilities and faster compile time.
